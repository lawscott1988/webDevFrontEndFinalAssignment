			<div class="left_div"><p>I came over to London at the end of 2010 from Australia. I had never experienced any snow before that point in my life. I was staying in a hostel in south west London. I woke up in the morning and behind the hostel I saw the snow flakes falling. Needless to say I was way too excited. This photo you see is my first sight of snow.</p></div>

			<div class="right_div"><p>I've been to a few places around Europe since coming to London. One of the best places to check out would be Paris. It is exteremly expensive there. I've been there twice now and I bought a pint for 8euros across the road from the Moulin Rouge. I tried snails which I absolutely love and also got a chance to see the Moulin Rouge itself! The picture you see is of me lying underneath the Eiffel Tower. It's pretty good photo if I do say so myself!</p></div>

			<div class="left_div"><p>Egypt is a place where time had stood still in some parts. In this photo you would never guess that on the other side there is a spawling city. It feels like you're right in the middle of the desert. I went inside The Great Pyramid and I can't explain how hot it was in the main room. The weather in Cairo and Giza I found to be very humid, but as you work your way down Egypt towards Luxor it starts to get much more dry. Egypt is a must for your list.</p></div>
