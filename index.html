			<h1>This is me!</h1>

				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
					<p>Hi! My name is Scott, and I've been programming for a few years now. I've found it be one of the most challenging things i've ever done, but it's because it's the first time in my life I've persisted at something continiously.</p>

				<h2>What to do...</h2>
					<p>If you're unsure where to go from here, might I suggest clicking on a few of the links up top. I'm going to include as many things as I can to make this web page as intersting as possible. In any case I hope you enjoy the showcase of my skills in front-end web developement</p>

			<h2>Filler information :D</h2>
				<p>I'm suprised you have scrolled down this far. I mean, it's mostly a complete waste of time. You should just give a brother full marks for this assignment ;). I wrote this bad boy from scratch, no frameworks or anything. Mostly because I wanted to get the foundations down. I originally wanted to do it with bootstrap, but I felt like I was skipping a lot of the basic. Plus bootstrap sucks.</p>
